# Astar

# Goal - Compute the optimal path from start to goal.
The car is moving on a 2D grid and its orientation can be chosen from four different directions:
forward = [[-1,  0], # 0: go north
           [ 0, -1], # 1: go west
           [ 1,  0], # 2: go south
           [ 0,  1]] # 3: go east

# The car can perform 3 actions: 
-1: right turn and then move forward,
 0: move forward
 1: left turn and then move forward
 
 To test the correctness of your A* implementation, when using cost = [1, 1, 10] your code should return 

['-', '-', '-', 'R', 'F', 'R']
['-', '-', '-', 'F', '-', 'F']
['*', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'R']
['-', '-', '-', 'F', '-', '-']
['-', '-', '-', 'F', '-', '-'] 

In this case, the elements in your closed set (i.e. the expanded nodes) are: 
(4, 3, 0)
(3, 3, 0)
(2, 3, 0)
(2, 4, 3)
(1, 3, 0)
(2, 5, 3)
(0, 3, 0)
(0, 4, 3)
(0, 5, 3)
(1, 5, 2)
(2, 5, 2)
(2, 4, 1)
(2, 3, 1)
(2, 2, 1)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 0, 1)
